## 👋 Hi, I’m Jonathan

I’m a Senior Talent Acquisition Partner at Ocado Technology, working closely with engineering and data leaders to build high-performing technical teams.

I’m not an engineer, and I don’t pretend to be one, but I care deeply about understanding how engineers actually work so I can hire better and partner better. I'm also here to help the GH communities by giving more insight into technical interview practises, hopefully supporting your career journey.  

### Why I’m on GitHub
This profile exists to help technology professionals navigate and succeed in modern interview processes, particularly in markets where talent is scarce and competition is high. It also serves as a place to document my journey working within the technology space, sharing lessons learned from building fair, practical, and transparent hiring processes.

### What I do
- Find and hire engineers, analysts & scientists
- Scale teams 
- Partner with hiring managers on interview quality, not just speed
- Focus heavily on candidate experience and inclusive hiring
- Find the best talent on the market

### What I’m learning (continuously)
- How engineers use GitHub in real-world teams
- Source candidates through GitHub (sorry!)
