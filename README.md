## 👋 Hi, I’m Jonathan

I’m a Senior Talent Acquisition Partner at Ocado Technology, working closely with engineering and data leaders to build high-performing technical teams.

I’m not an engineer — and I don’t pretend to be one — but I care deeply about understanding how engineers actually work so I can hire better and partner better. I'm also here to help the GH communities by giving more insight into technical interview practises, hopefully supporting your career journey.  

### What I do
- Hire data engineers, data analysts, ML engineers, data scientists and software engineers
- Scale teams 
- Partner with hiring managers on interview quality, not just speed
- Focus heavily on candidate experience and inclusive hiring

### What I’m learning (continuously)
- How engineers use GitHub in real-world teams
- Source candidates through GitHub (sorry!)
- Find the best talent on the market

### Why I’m on GitHub
This profile is part of my effort to better understand the tools and workflows engineers use every day, and to be a more credible, informed recruitment partner as a result.

I share examples of interview processes, assessment frameworks and scorecards (never questions or answers) to help make technical interviews more transparent, fair and predictable for candidates.
